CSP1150 Assignment

This assignment is a 'Know It All' program, which quizzes you on pre-set categories consisting of multiple answers.
It involves 2 python programs: 'admin.py', a program to manage the categories, add new ones, etc, and 'kia.py', a gui program that quizzes the player
Data is passed between the 2 programs via a file, 'data.txt', which is not a part of this repository, as it is automatically created by the program when it is needed.
